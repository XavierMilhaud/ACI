\arguments{
\item{precipitation_file}{A string specifying the path to the netCDF file containing precipitation data.}

\item{mask_file}{A string specifying the path to the netCDF file containing mask data.}

\item{reference_period}{A character vector specifying the start and end of the reference period. If NULL, the object's
reference period is used.}

\item{selected_latitude}{A numeric value specifying the latitude of the location to visualize.}

\item{selected_longitude}{A numeric value specifying the longitude of the location to visualize.}

\item{month_year}{A string in the format "YYYY-MM" specifying the month and year for the anomaly map.}

None
Apply mask to precipitation data

This method applies the mask to the precipitation data, setting precipitation values to NA where the mask
indicates it should not be considered (e.g., non-land areas or outside of the study region).

None
Calculate the maximum consecutive dry days

This method calculates the maximum number of consecutive dry days (days with precipitation below a certain threshold)
for each location and time period in the masked precipitation data.

None
Interpolate drought data between years

This method interpolates drought data for each month between years to provide a continuous dataset. It handles the
interpolation using a linear weighting scheme between consecutive years and repeats the last year's values.
Standardize the drought metric

This method standardizes the drought metric (maximum consecutive dry days) based on a reference period. The standardization
is performed by calculating z-scores relative to the reference period.

None
Visualize standardized drought anomalies over time

This method creates a time series plot of the standardized drought anomalies for a specific location defined by
latitude and longitude.

A ggplot object showing the time series of standardized drought anomalies.
Plot standardized drought anomaly map for a specific month and year

This method creates a spatial plot of standardized drought anomalies for a specified month and year.

A ggplot object showing the spatial distribution of standardized drought anomalies for the specified month and year.

\description{
A class to handle drought data analysis based on precipitation data and a mask.
This class can calculate and standardize the maximum number of consecutive dry days,
apply spatial masks, visualize standardized drought anomalies, and plot drought anomaly maps.

Initialize a DroughtComponent object

from netCDF files and applying the mask to filter relevant data.}
