\value{
A data.table containing combined sea level data from all text files.
Correct date format in sea level data

This method converts the numeric date format in the sea level data to a standard Date format.

A data.table with corrected date format.
Clean sea level data

This method replaces missing values (denoted by -99999) with NA in the sea level data.

A cleaned data.table with missing values replaced by NA.
Compute monthly statistics for sea level data

This method computes monthly means or standard deviations for sea level data within a reference period.

A data.table containing monthly means or standard deviations of sea level data.
Standardize sea level data

This method standardizes sea level data by calculating z-scores based on monthly means and standard deviations.

A data.table containing standardized sea level data with z-scores.
Process sea level data

This method processes sea level data by loading, correcting date format, cleaning, computing monthly statistics,
standardizing, and returning the standardized data.

A data.table containing standardized sea level data with z-scores.
Plot rolling mean of sea level data

This method creates a plot of the rolling mean of standardized sea level data over a specified window.

A ggplot object showing the rolling mean of sea level data over time.
Convert data to xarray format

This method converts a data.table to an xarray DataArray using the reticulate package to interface with Python.

An xarray DataArray object representing the sea level data.
Resample sea level data

This method resamples sea level data to a quarterly frequency by computing the mean for each quarter.

A data.table containing resampled sea level data with quarterly means.
Save data to NetCDF format

This method saves a data.table to a NetCDF file using the xarray Python library.
